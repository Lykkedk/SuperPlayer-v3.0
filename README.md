# SuperPlayer-v3.0

This is intended to be a new howto for a new release of SuperPlayer.

I have created an installer script, so to have newest camilladsp-v0.5.0-beta2 along with the GUI.\
The installer is downloaded here :: https://github.com/Lykkedk/SuperPlayer-Extensions/archive/CDSP-install-v1.0.zip

It could be directly downloaded into the Raspberry Pi with wget...
'''wget https://github.com/Lykkedk/SuperPlayer-Extensions/archive/CDSP-install-v1.0.zip'''
